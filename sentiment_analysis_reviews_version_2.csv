10800,It was mostly good except the peanut butter cookie dough had yucky aftertaste. My husband agreed.

2504,"Good bread with seeds. I love a seedy bread sometimes, though this one doesn’t have as many seeds as other brands but it is organic. Most organic bread have a shorter shelf life than non-organic and even more true of these ones available through Fresh.My biggest gripe is with Amazon Fresh as I often receive bread that is squished. My last loaf was completely punched in. The middle of the loaf was about 25% of the size. Not really usable for sandwiches and way too dense from being squished down to enjoy in other forms. Also, do they not rotate items so that it’s first in, first out??? Almost always arrive with short expiration dates and molds quickly. Never experience these issues whenever I go to a grocery store and pick out my own loaf.Don’t bother if you know you can’t finish the loaf or freeze within a few days.",positive

They came highly recommended to me by several of my friends that I've made at the gym and I am happy that I purchased them. After about 1.5 weeks of taking 2 capsules a day, I've noticed an increase in mood, energy, libido, and most importantly a decrease in my overall belly fat.

Usually there are 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 yellow wires coming out of the ballast. This is not a simple replacement wiring.

I included a photo of the one I ordered on Amazon. My order came with 3 boxes of delicious cornflakes, chocolate chip, marshmallow cookies. So I gifted a box to my mom. She's a new fan of my fav cookie! They were fresh and yummy.",positive

4386,Wish I could give it 6 stars! This ice cream stays in my freezer! I'm completely obsessed,positive
4385,This stuff has been my downfall. I've had to learn to eat it in moderation. It is my number one favorite Icecream ive ever had. My husband doesn't even have to ask what kind I want anymore it's always half baked!,positive
4388,This is by far my favorite icecream brand. This flavor is great too! It has both chocolate and vannilla icecream,positive
4393,"I ate a pint of this in one go. No regrets. I think this flavor is much better than Phish Food, which is another flavor of Ben and Jerry's. With both cookie dough and brownie, you can't go wrong.",positive

4400,I really love the all around flavor of Strawberry Cheesecake Icecream. But honestly I don't think I tasted more than 2 tiny tiny pieces of the cheesecake. Maybe it should have been named strawberry and graham crackers.,negative

5727,"Because Im in college and only live in a dorm, these little pints of ice cream are really convenient. Theyre small enough to fit in the small freezer space of a mini fridge. Mint chocolate chip is my favorite flavor, but every flavor of Ben & Jerrys that Ive purchased has been good.",positive
11791,"I tried the chocolate fudge brownie about a week ago and I was a little disappointed because of the flavor. I felt like the chocolate ice cream could have tasted a bit sweeter and a lot more creamier. The ice cream tastes like water, but the brownies made it enjoyable.",negative

4389,"Considering the fact that chocolate ice cream isn't my favorite, the ratio was unequal",neutral

2547,Tasty and fuzzy!,positive

2549,"I bought this kombucha, because it was on sale, big mistake! It has a vinegar after taste. I would not buy this again even if it goes on sale again. Yuck!",negative
2550,The best Kombucha,positive
2551,The best flavor of this brand in my opinion. 2nd pomegranate. Could be cheaper though,positive
2552,Love this flavor. It’s subtle and not too sweet like most fruity flavors. Easy to drink regularly.,positive
2553,Absolutely love this. It's light and not overpowering. Super refreshing,positive
2554,I love it and I don’t care who knows it.,positive

2563,"I personally didn’t love the taste of these beats compared to another brand I purchase. However, if you don’t want a lot of flavor added such as vinegar or ginger spices added these are great to put on salads.",negative
2564,Great tasting,positive
2565,Its done exactly how a fresh beet should b♡,positive
2566,Excellent taste and texture.Love these beets. Don't plan to ever cook raw beets so this is the best.,positive
2567,Love the flavor and ready to eat,positive
2568,Beets highly underrated. I like to marinate these with some smoked paprika and a lil white wine vinegar/salt and a dash of sugar and do them with a lil vegan ricotta n shaved shallots with arugula or spinach. They’re also good plain as a quick snack.,positive
2569,"Great tasting, well packed.",positive
2570,Especially when you don't feel like cooking your own. Taste home-cooked.,positive
2571,"Bought them once from Costco & haven't seen them since. I bought another brand from Amazon (brand name begins with G) and they are not nearly as good as this brand. Since I don't frequent many stores during 2020, I was excited to see them when ordering my Amazon Fresh delivery. Bought four boxes. More spendy than when I got them from Costco but worth it.",positive
2572,Lasts a long time in the fridge! very yummy and not as hard and it looks.,positive
2573,I really wish I liked these. Have an odd taste. Not sure what from.,negative
2574,"You can find them cheaper at the bulk stores, but I am trying to stream line my grocery shopping during COVID and ordering from Whole Foods for curb side pick up is very easy for me.They taste wonderful. I have used them in all types of salad recipes along with on their own with just a little goat cheese, chopped walnuts, and balsamic vinegar and they are always delicious. I have also made a copy cat version of a cold quinoa and beet salad a local deli serves. A great vegetable to include in our salad rotation and a great source of fiber! To me these cooked beets are worth the convenience of not having to roast and peel my own and stain my hands/ kitchen!Also, this may be tmi- but for those interested in GI health: the natural color in beets is hard for your body to break down, so if you eat enough of them in one sitting you can use them to check your gastric transit time ( I like to aim to keep mine 24 to 48 hours tops, any slower and I feel I have increased digestive issues)!",positive
2575,"I love beets, but these were inedible. Not sure if maybe they were spoiled, or whether they were just cooked to death. Either way, they smelled bad and they tasted worse, even in a smoothie.",negative
2576,Very good,positive
2577,"Not too much vinegar, something common with many other brands. Cooked to just the right consistency. I enjoy them cold from the refrigerator, usually one or two at a time as a salad.",positive
2578,Tasted fresh and were cooked tender.,positive
2579,"So tasty and great for salads. No prep or cooking, just cut and add. Love them!",positive
2580,These were surprisingly flavorful and incredibly easy to use.,positive
2581,Great flavor!,positive
2582,Very tasty and perfect for a quick meal.,positive
2583,Yucky. Taste like plastic. Will not buy again.,negative
2584,"Tastes really weird, at the same time there is almost no flavor. The texture is also very strange. Had to discard.",negative
2585,Taste better than flour tortillas and without the gluten.,positive
2586,Delicious but very expensive,neutral
2587,Toasted on grill or warm it up in microwave for few seconds and it will taste amazing.,positive
2588,My family doesn’t like them but I love them. In the beginning they’d crack but once I placed them in the freezer and thawed before using they didn’t crack like before.,positive
2589,Auto-immune friendly. No adverse reaction. I can have a wrap again. Made a pizza with vegan cheese. Had with my homemade bean spread and vegan cheese. Filled wrap with tuna and spring mix. This product has given me more options.,positive
2590,"LOVE their chips. These unfortunately don’t fill the tortilla gap, but I hope they keep trying!",positive
2591,It tastes too overly sweet for a tortilla. Maybe try the almond flour instead.,negative
2592,Hint: run them through a mini waffle iron for 60 seconds and they're good to go. Now we can make anything taco!,positive
3781,Solid product. I can definitely feel the increase in energy leading to better performance at the gym.,positive
2593,"If you are gluten free these are a great find. But there is a trick to using them for quick wraps. I put mine in the microwave for 10-20 secs and they are just right. Any longer and they get hard on the edges. Great quick lunch with hummus, turkey and broccoli sprouts.",positive
2594,"The texture and taste of these really floored me. I don't normally eat gluten-free, but due to some recent health setbacks, I'm trying it out for the moment. These might remain in my normal rotation for life, though. Give them a try--they're FANTASTIC. Pliable and flavorful.",positive
2595,Warm up in microwave for 20 seconds and they’re perfect!,positive
2596,Yummy,positive
2597,"These are absolutely amazing!! I’m somewhat new to being gluten-free, and I’m also super picky about GF foods. These tortillas are heavenly! When you follow the directions to gently heat them in a pan for a few minutes, they come out soft, pliable, and do NOT fall apart. The flavor is so subtle, you can be fooled into thinking they’re flour tortillas. Yes, they’re expensive, but they’re totally worth it in my book. I’m sure these can be made from scratch for less, but in a pinch, I’m buying these every single time.",positive
2598,"At first touch, these seem to have a weird texture but once you heat them and fill them up with yummy stuff, they make really good tacos!",positive
2599,I liked the taste abs quality. I will buy them again,positive
2600,I love these but so hard to find,positive
2601,These are not like the cassava tortillas you can make yourself at home. Those are tasty & closer in texture to a flour tortilla. I expected these to be the same & ordered out of convenience. Holy cow these were one of the worst things I’d ever eaten! These seemed like they dissolved into mush in my mouth. The texture was closer to a rubbery corn tortilla than a flour tortilla but at least a corn tortilla taste way better. These break apart like corn tortillas when you wrap them so you’d have to double them up but they’re so bad you don’t even want one. Can’t even give these away. Dog didn’t even want them so threw them away.,negative
2602,These turned into our favorite go to for taco night. Easy to heat and they are delicious. Amazing corn alternative!,positive
2603,"The siete cassava flour tortillas are my favorite grain free tortillas! They’re a little brittle right ouf the package, but if you warm them up (I use the open flame on my gas stove) they’re perfect! I think they’re overpriced, but they do go on sale periodically so stock up!",positive
2604,"Tastes like paper, cooks like paper! I would recommend this to termites, silver fish, and field mice (for nest building only!!!)",negative
2605,"Out of all the grain free tortillas, these are our favorite. To get the right texture and warmth, one needs a tortilla warmer. They do burn fast if you don’t watch them. The are great for tacos, but if you fill them too much, they don’t have the structure to hold it all. They are a bit expensive for what you get, but they go on sale at Whole Foods for $5.39 every once in a while. Most often they come to Whole Foods frozen already and Whole Foods thaws them out. So know they are pre frozen. You can buy in bulk and freeze them at home when they go on sale.",positive
2606,"Love siete products, but the wraps break too easily- they don't roll well. There are better gluten free wraps out there.",negative
2607,Love this brand - and its such a great option for alternative tortilla. I feel great after eating.,positive
2608,"Love taste, but not price.",positive
2609,"Horrible. I'd rather go without than eat these again. I try to abstain from gluten, but won't purchase these again.",negative
2610,"So this item was given as a substitute for another tortilla brand and overall, I’m not disappointed. They do have sort of a weird smell, and very very think once you warm them, but..... they’re friendly for like every diet and healthy sooo..... that’s a compromise I’m willing to make. They’re light and airy so I didn’t feel guilty eating them!",positive
2611,Totally love my tortillas delicious better than regular flour tortillas,positive
2612,"I want to love the siete brand but they are not like regular tortillas. The problem is that when cooking them, they are very soft and not sturdy. They curl and break. Not recommended",negative
2613,"I like making quesadillas with these, a little tougher to use for wraps, etc. But the flavor is good",positive
2614,"These tortillas are top-notch. So happy to find such a healthy, limited-ingredient tortilla to make my toddler quesadillas:) thanks!",positive
2615,Heading says it all...,neutral
2616,Costs way more than ingredients demand. Price goes over the logical threshold.,negative
2617,This was a new product for me and I ended up eating a few of them and throwing the rest in the compost. I wouldn't purchase these again.,negative
2618,"We have celiac, these hold together like what I remember “real” flour tortillas did.Taste great too, they are slippery so you know they aren’t the other kind, but it was nice to have a taco that didn’t fall apart’",positive
2619,"Honestly, I didn't like the flavor and texture. It also doesn't heat well. Crumbles rather.",negative
2620,"It is difficult to find gfree food alternatives, and I am so lucky I found this one! I was so happy to make meat and cheese quesadillas and look forward to more recipes. It is really nice just to eat the foods I love without having to worry about food allergies.",positive
2621,These are absolutely AWFUL. Taste horrible and are really thin and crumbly. They do NOT work as a wrap at all because they break Into pieces . And they're expensive!!! I don't know why they replaced the Udi's with these. Udi's blow these out of the Park. Very disappointed- I guess we won't be eating wraps anymore until we find something else.,negative
2622,These are my absolute favorite tortillas... but unfortunately they are way too expensive for what you get. Double the amount of tortillas would be worth it. Splurge buy when I want to treat myself or when they’re on sale! Great for egg tacos :),positive
2623,"These aren't tortillas as much as they are cassava crumbles temporarily shaped like tortillas, which will soon revert to their original form. Any handling, folding, wrapping, or even biting, results in these extremely thin and brittle cassava wafers breaking up into dry, mealy pieces. It is impossible to use these to hold other ingredients; in other words, these fail as a burrito, soft-taco, taquito, or quesadilla. The flavor is non-existent, and the cost is considerably unbalanced, since you only get 8 micron-thin tortillas, which barely function as it is.",negative
2624,"I love these. Been gluten intolerant for over 20 yrs. and these are a joy.The flavor is really good, the gentle starchy mouth feel is great. They are WAY tastier warm than cold so take the time to heat them. Wrap in lightly dampened paper towel if microwaving. If heating in a skillet watch them closely and wrap them up quickly as they will harden quickly (awesome for tortas!).Jicama wraps do a number on my stomach and corn fogs my brain and my GI tract. These are a great alternative. Just don't eat too many (more than 2 or 3) in one sitting or they can cause some GI rumbling/distress (from the cassava flour). This is more of a problem with their chips, which are REALLY delicious and easy to eat too many in one sitting!",positive
2625,I LOVE these. They are perfect. When I found out I had a gluten and dairy issue I was devastated because I made wraps almost every day with tortillas and the gluten free ones were gross. So happy to of found these and they taste amazing. Just make sure you warm them up as instructed and they're the best. I like them more than my old ones,positive
2626,"We use these to make rollups with either lunch meat or chicken sausages (like a hot dog). Follow the directions and they turn out great. Not tough, and don't crack like the almond version.",positive
2627,"Love this brand! These taste a tad bit better than the 360 store brand.. although, more expensive.",positive
2628,Hoping would be Keto friendly but far from it. Probably my fault for not looking at the entire description,negative
2629,"Great product, amazing price, HIGHLY recommend!",positive
2630,Very good gluten and grain-free tortillas!,positive
2631,"I want to love these, because it would be awesome to find a great gluten free tortilla. Unfortunately these are just okay & they are mighty expensive for being okay. These break a part almost instantly with you like to make wraps. Taste is bland, texture is a bit weird.",negative
2632,These are the best tasting Keto friendly tortillas ever. Hands down.,positive
2633,"I am highly allergic to anything with wheat flour, gluten or almonds/nuts. These tortillas were delicious and easy to digest! Very tasty, I use them to make sandwich wraps with ham and cheese. Will buy again!",positive
2634,"Love Siete tortillas, they are healthier and better overall.",positive
2635,"I really loved these tortillas. Completely satisfied my tortilla craving while on keto, but don’t get it twisted, I’m probably not going to buy these often. They are pricey. (Ordering cassava flour after I finish this review). I was afraid the vinegar ingredient in these would be strong (loath vinegar) but I couldn’t taste it all! I think I actually like these better than store bought flour tortillas. I find flour tortillas too salty and doughy for my taste. I also like that these are thin and very light in flavor.",positive
2636,We love these tortillas so much. They’re great warmed up if you’d like a softer tortilla and you can also crisp them up really good in a cast iron pan. These have become a staple in our household if you know someone who is avoiding both corn and gluten.,positive
2637,Excellent taste and great substitute for people with allergies but way over priced. Talk about price gouging how much does it cost to make these a nickel and they are not using organic ingredients and they are thin. Maybe a couple penny's. The ziploc bag they come in cost more to manufacture. Taking advantage of people with Celiac and corn allergies. I have them in a pinch and glad they are available but just cant believe the cost.I can make these using organic cassava flour that are not thin and the kids have a good time.,positive
2638,"I love these because they are so neutral tasting. They obviously aren’t a white flour tortilla, but as close to as I can get to enjoying.Pros:- They are not gummy- They don’t have an aftertaste- They're best slightly warmed, fried, or toasted.👉 if you see the boxed taco shells by this brand ...BUY THEM!!! OMG soooo good (my hubby is addicted to them)I haven’t purchased the chips, I can’t validate $5 for minimal amount in bag.",positive
2639,Okay these are really disgusting and expensive! Very weird taste. I threw them out. If you can find the Siete almond flour ones go with those they're good.,negative
2640,"I love that there are minimal ingredients and no unnecessary fillers, but they just don’t provide the flavor I like for my tacos.",negative
2641,"Where have you been all my life? I don’t know how you manage to make these so light tasting, but pliable enough to fill with lunch meats and veggies, or taco beef, or eggs and veggies and the list goes on. I can’t have gluten, grains, or nuts. What’s left? Cassava, coconut flour, and chic pea flours. I thought there were no sandwiches in my future. But, then I found these. Thank you!!!!!",positive
2642,"I saw these at my local market in the frozen section and was intrigued, but they were super pricey! As someone who is always on a quest to eat clean and flour tortillas are never on my menu, I just had to give these a shot. I made 2 breakfast tacos with spiced up ground turkey, eggs and salsa (hold the cheese :/). I cooked the tortillas right on the burner to give them that slightly charred flavor and wow! These did not disappoint. They have a slight chew just like a flour tortilla that has gluten in it, and they hold together tremendously! If someone served these to me without telling me they weren't flour, I would have sworn I was eating flour tortillas. And I grew up eating homemade flour tortillas. Anyway, if you can get past the price (you can't put a price tag on your health) then I would definitely recommend giving these a try. I haven't ordered them on line so I haven't had an issue with freshness.",positive
2643,Fungus issues,negative
2644,"Although a bit pricey, these are simply the tastiest tortillas I've ever had. They are thin, easy to cook, and surprisingly strong for how thin the tortilla is. These have been a game changer in taco Tuesdays.",positive
2645,I hate corn tortillas... But these actually taste pretty good.,positive
2646,"Was pleasantly surprised with this tortillas, really a great option for gluten free",positive
2647,"This is a plain tasting tortilla much like a flour one. It is a great substitute for those who can’t have gluten, aka lectins. I recommend that you hear them up or fry them before eating so the fold easier without breaking. The only bummer is that there are only 8 in a pack; I wish they more.",positive
2648,"I don't normally leave reviews but HOT DANG, these tortillas were so delicious for my first time trying. Paint the scene: I woke up hungover, took me until 10am before I could leave the couch. Then, I remembered I had these tortillas to try and I slowly made moves to the kitchen. I made 2 breakfast tacos and topped off with their cashew queso, it was mehhh, and at first bite I was sold on the tortillas. 1. There was a delightful crunch when I took my first bite. 2. The tortillas didn't break AT ALL for being on the thinner side. At this point, I was already sold based on this delightful experience. But after eating and feeling more revived, I ran back to the fridge just to see the nutrition facts and here goes my run on sentence - THANK YOU SO MUCH SIESTE FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT A NORMAL SERVING SIZE TO PEOPLE IS 2 TORTILLAS and recognizing that it is silly when brands put one tortilla as a serving knowing full well people have at least 2. Now I will say at roughly a dollar per tortilla I put them on the pricey end, but these are the best tasting gluten free tortillas I have ever had will be definitely continue purchasing in the future!",positive
2649,can't believe how delicious and filling they are,positive
2650,Better than I could have imagined! These have the elasticity of the best legit tortillas - I’ve tested their structural integrity with loads of fillings and mmmmm they did not disappoint.,positive
2651,These tortillas are awesome!!! I spray a little cooking spray in the pan and then flip them till they have light brown spots. You don’t want to over cook them or on high heat.,positive
2652,They break very easily and are difficult to wrap anything.,negative
2653,These were horrible. Terrible texture and broke apart as you tried to use it for a burrito or taco. Do not recommend.,negative
2654,These taste fantastic and it’s a great alternative for a someone who does not eat wheat,positive
2655,These are horrible. Absolutely one of the worst things I’ve ever tried. I literally couldn’t give them away to a homeless person. If I could give zero stars I would.,negative
2656,Expensive but good alternative to wheat!,postive
2657,The best paleo tortillas,positive
2658,By far my favorite tortillas! When I don’t have the time to make my own cassava tortillas these are great!,positive
2659,"These are a great option if you have dietary restrictions, however the almond flour have a better taste and consistency if you can tolerate the ingredients. These cassava ones missed the mark for me, won’t be buying again!",negative
2660,This is one of the best grain free wraps. My favorite is the coconut and cassava. Works great for my busy life.,positive
2661,Delish,positive
2662,These are a great substitute for regular tortillas. If they are warmed up correctly they are playable and can be used the same as a regular flour tortilla. Mexican food is a staple in our home and with myself eating Paleo these will help it stay that way! I see some people complain about the cost but I will pay the price over having to make my own that don’t turn out nearly as good! Worth every penny! Thanks Siete!,positive
2663,🤢,negative
2664,For a grain free product these are outstanding. They obviously don’t taste like a traditional flour tortilla but they’re a great substitute.,positive
2665,LOOOOVE these. I heated these up in a pan with Ghee and butter until they turned brown in some areas and they were absolutely perfect as a substitute to Naan. I would buy them often if were not for the price.,positive
2666,tortilla! More flavor! Breakfast burrito!,positive
2667,These are great! Don't crack as easily as some other grain free tortillas and good flavor.,positive
2668,Obscenely expensive and too dry to wrap anything.,negative
2669,Yuck these are nasty! Lol! They break apart and are dry. Just go tortilla-less.,negative
2670,This are the worst example of a grain free tortilla ever. Quite honestly. Hard dried put card board.,negative
2671,Love the tastI should know it am picky,positive
2672,I got this package and the tortillas were moldy! I had not let them sit outside in the mail for longer than an hour and they were on ice! Green spots all over them and have not heard back about a refund......,negative
2673,had to throw away because ice pack was melted.,negative
2674,"Great tasting tortillas, I highly recommend them but too... expensive but You can get them at whole food Market for less than $8.",positive
2675,If I could write 0 stars I would. As you can see in the photo there is mold on this item. And when I tried to return it there is a “no return available” on this item. I wouldn’t want it back either!!! And I was so hopeful to find this product!,negative
2676,Good but expensive,positive
2677,Why!! They're so good!!,positive
2678,very tastywell buy again,positive
2679,These completely fall apart when used as a wrap. But I at least feel like I’m getting something like a carb when I eat with my chicken and greens. I suggest just eating in place of a dinner roll if your diet requires.,negative
2680,I loved it.Very good taste.,positive
2681,This is a heavy dough. I would give five stars if the manufacturer cut the pizza in half so you could use in two portions. Or make two individuals in one package.,positive
2682,"Delicious! Gluten free and full of protein, what more could you want!",positive
2683,This was surprisingly good.,positive
2684,"Made with olive oil! Yay!!!!! I finally found a pizza that my non-celiac family loves as much as I do, the celiac. We top with pepperoni and fresh mozzarella. The basil in this pizza really sends it over the top. It tastes like it was just picked from the herb garden. This is so good without a laundry list of ingredients that are questionable or just bad for you. Most seed oils are so toxic. I only use olive, avocado, coconut oil. Also only ghee, tallow or butter. Back to what nature intended. Thank you Banza! We also love your chickpea elbows!",positive
2685,This is the best best best gluten free pizza crust. I absolutely love it. I make my own toppings - pesto greens and mushrooms - for this crust and the crust never falls apart or is soggy. It's also delicious,positive
2686,So delicious! I love the texture and taste!,positive
2687,This is incredibly good. It is hard to find in stores. Delivery was perfect.,positive
2688,Tastes amazing. Better than cauliflower crust. Crunchy and it’s PIZZA! Love the crust. Will be buying more.,positive
2689,My roommate and I love these pizzas. Great to curb the pizza cravings with less of the guilt.,positive
2690,So overpriced for a small mediocre pizza,negative
2691,"Wow, I’m not even GF and this was delicious, especially for a frozen pizza. I added fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, and shaved some parm on top and it was, chefs kiss!",positive
2692,I loved the flavor and the thought that I don’t feel as guilty when I chow down on one of these! Thank you Banza.,positive
2693,The BEST cauliflower crust pizza. Wow. I like it better than real pizza.,positive
2694,Healthy and good flavor! Finally delicious pizza with less guilt!,positive
2695,Everyone liked it. No complaints.,positive
2696,This crust is delicious. I’m gluten free and vegan but I loveee pizza and there are very few options out there for me so I was stoked to find this. It’s got lots of protein and cooks to a crisp and has a very similar flavor to regular crust- I actually like it better and eat this regularly with sauce and vegan cheese!,positive
2697,"This is really good pizza. My toddler eats it, so that's high praise!",positive
2698,not a chickpea fan but this pizza was great,positive
2699,It taste very good. It is gluten free made from chickpea which is great. Only problem is its a bit expensive.,positive
2700,"I have been gluten free For 4 years. As a pizza lover this has been hard. Gluten free pizza crust is generally meh. I insist I have tried them all.... and this is possibly the best gf pizza crust that I have ever had. The only other ones that rank high are Newman’s own gf (which is more thin and crisp) and against the grain (which is an entirely different experience) this is way better than any cauliflower, almond, grain free, Keto, what have you crust I’ve tried. It’s almost like bread. I would highly recommend.",positive
2701,This pizza is amazing! Love all banza products and this pizza is the best gf pizza ive had yet 😋,positive
2702,Love it,positive
2703,Love all of Banza’s products and this definitely didn’t disappoint. Not a big fan of the veggie one but the margarita one is so good. If you’re a cheese lover would definitely add some extra though.,positive
2704,"It’s a tasty wheat , refined sugar alternative . Discovered this on Monday. It’s now Saturday and I’m having my fourth.",positive
2705,"Great product, healthy and delicious!",positive
2706,this is healthy bread. toasted with butter or my daily sandwiches for lunch,positive
2707,"If you like Peanut Butter & Chocolate, it’s the best snack bar around!",positive
2708,"Make sure to refrigerate these.. These are so delicious.. that I ate them all in one day.. Thus, not very healthy.. ha ha ha..Definitely worth the buy!",positive
2709,Delish and filling!,positive
2710,This thing tastes great. Like really good. But that's because it basically IS a candy bar - lots of fat and sugar and feels greasy. Also its super dense and felt like a brick in my stomach. I felt a little constipated the next morning.,positive
2711,I like this flavor better than just the peanut butter because it has what seems to be flax seeds on the top. They’re so yummy!!! Rich and like cookie dough! Yum!!,positive
2712,Love these!,positive
2713,"My shopper decided to sub this for a candy bar, not the same. The taste and texture were disgusting. You can get the same fat, carbs and protein by just eating 4 TB of peanut butter",negative
2714,The best bar,positive
2715,"If you know what is good for you, be forewarned, these are basically crack chocolate chip goodness. Honestly, I eat an alarming number of these things.",positive
2716,"I would give negative stars if I could. I love the other flavors, but this one is just gross.",negative
2717,I love these bars! But recently I realized they were triggering my intolerance to lactose. Great bars but not if you’re lactose sensitive.,positive
2718,Perfect indeed!,positive
2719,Best breakfast bars ever! They are pricey but so worth it,positive
2720,Not my favorite flavor but I do love these bars.,neutral
2721,As the title says this is the best brand of protein bar ive ever had. Doesnt taste like processed garbage and actually satiates the sweet tooth! You do have to kee em refrigerated and if h keenit in your pocket for too long itll melt so best to keep em at and not bring em directly to the gym (or use a cooler at least or somethin),positive
2722,Ordered through FRESH. Clearly Amazon did not think to store this in the cold while delivering this to me. By the time it got to me it was soggy and warm. I was very dissappointed as I love them.,positive
2723,Full flavor great snack for any time of the day.,positive
2724,Seriously so good. No other words. Just so good.,positive
2725,"Nutritious and Delicious. Great taste, good nutrition and good quality. Keeps you full for a long time.",positive
2726,Love these! So delicious. Expensive though.,positive
2727,My favorite protein bars!,positive
2728,Very good taste didn’t upset my stomach just wished it was bigger,positive
2729,Nasty aftertaste like it’s spoiled,negative
2730,Just what I wanted.,positive
2731,"I absolutely LOVE these bars!! I've been eating them just about every morning for the last 6 months maybe even longer than that! I am not super hungry in the morning and I find these help me get in some protein and carbs in so I don't end up completely famished by my next meal. I work a very early shift and one bar with my coffee is exactly what I need to start my day! I am so happy to see them available just about everywhere now, I first saw them at Natural Grocer's ,then I found them at Trader Joe's! Now I see them at most of the main stores in my area ( Safeway, Kroger's and Walmart) and even at Starbucks. The price varies greatly but I am glad I have the option to purchase it many different places.",positive
2732,Who doesn’t love peanut butter,positive
2733,These are so good! Very filling.,positive
2734,"yum, my fav perfect bar.",positive
2735,Peanut butter lovers unite!,positive
2736,Good,positive
2737,Good,positive
2738,"I love this bar so much, but I love almond butter and its basically like eating almond butter in bar form to me.",positive
2739,These are amazing !!! Wish i would have found out about these before now.,positive
2740,Great bar,positive
2741,"Our son is crazy about these bars. They provide some great nutrition, while tasting great. Our son is on the picky side with everything.",positive
2742,"I never write reviews but Perfect Bars deserve one. It’s near perfect. I’ve eaten one every day for three years. Sometimes two. The texture is incredible and taste is spot on. Peanut butter and dark chocolate chip are my favorites, but Almond Butter and Peanut Coconut aren’t far behind. My only wishes (1) they have dairy. Wish they didn’t. (2) something with fruit would be amazing. Raspberries? They used to have a fruit & nut but that seems to have been discontinued. Please buy these bars so I can be assured an uninterrupted supply for my lifetime.",positive
2743,Not a bad flavor. Not addictive either.,positive
2744,"Great taste, very clean and healthy and perfect for breakfast or before a workout. I love these bars.",positive

3782,It actually works.,positive

3783,"I’ll start with the con, they are hard for me to swallow. Other than that they seem to help me overall. I feel more energetic. I’ve only taken then for one month but I can tell a difference. I’ve been pleased with the results.",positive
3784,Easy to swallow,positive
3785,I like this product. After talking this feel good energy .,positive
3786,"Just got them today for my husband, so I hope they do help.",positive
3787,GREAT PRODUCT,positive

3789,"So, fare so good. Packaged well. Easy to to take.",positive
3790,I like ‘em. They give you a little more pep in your step,positive
3791,it started to work in just a few days for my husband more energy and 💘😻,positive
3792,"My energy level had been low and my stamina was in the tank. I started noticing a difference within about two weeks. Stamina improved, I had initiative again to get up and get moving, exercise more and tackle physical jobs around the farm I had been avoiding. As a result of my increased activity level, I have lost weight and feel better than I’ve felt in the last few years. Finally, my quality of sleep has greatly improved and I generally feel better, look better (physically) and feel like my old self again.",positive

3798,I do feel I have more energy.,positive

It is very efficient and I can actually notice a burst of energy and increase in my strength when I am taking these daily and exercise than without it!,positive
3800,"This product gave me increased strength , i could fee the difference within 2 weeks . I only took 1 a day . Plus it kept my other muscle strong too. I took advantage of that on my trip to Colombia. A lot of happy Colombian mamacitas haha.",positive
3801,These are like eating air. And have zero nutrition. I’d rather get something out of my food for 100 calories. Save your money.,negative
4874,Americone is so delicious. I love the pieces of cone in the ice cream. The taste is amazing,positive
10803,"This is one of my favorite flavors! It has everything I'm looking for! Large mix-ins, a rich base, and lots of chocolate cookie swirls... so yummy!",positive
6976,"I was SO excited to try these but wasn't impressed, unfortunately. For the price and the hype, I was expecting to want to enjoy these daily... I'm not crazy about the taste and have found lower cost candy ""alternatives"" that I have really enjoyed much much better. ):",negative

13249,NO PROBLEMS HERE.,positive
13251,What can I say. They are battery’s. They work and they are way cheaper then buying them at the store.,positive
13252,Great value. Couldn’t find batteries for the security system. I ordered these from Amazon and they arrived within a couple of hours. Security system was up and operating.,positive
13253,"Bought a set of these batteries for my smoke detector - they last less than a month!?! I tried twice, then gave up and threw the rest out.",negative
